# unsupervised-learning
Ran different clustering techniques to segment NFL players accoding to fantasy stats (k-means, gaussian mixture model, heirarchical clustering)

To give some more context:
I wanted to see whichÂ unsupervised clustering method best groups up NFL players into tiers, given the data we've collected.

----
This project pulled player stats for the 2019 NFL fantasy season from pro-football-reference.com.

The dataset contains 620 NFL player stats (33 features) from 2019.

You can find the raw data csv files in this repo, as well as a copy of the colab notebook.

Enjoy!
